# CR_Project

This is the project for the "Connaissance et Raisonnement" course at Centrale Sup√©lec.

The aim of this project is to program a game in which the player starts in a random country and must go through the maximum countries possible. To move, the player must give the name of a neighboring country (with regards to the contry he is in) and answer a given question (finding the capital, the number of people living there, a trivia question about the local traditions, etc). The data that will be used to build this game will be taken from DBpedia and Wikidata.
