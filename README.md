# CR_Project

This is the project for the "Connaissance et Raisonnement" course @CentraleSupélec

#### Due date
:calendar: **28/02/2021**  

## :books: Subject of the project  

The aim of this project is to program a game in which the player starts in a random country and must go through the maximum countries possible. To move, the player must give the name of a neighboring country (with regards to the contry he is in) and answer a given question (finding the capital, the number of people living there, a trivia question about the local traditions, etc). 

The data that will be used to build this game will be taken from [DBpedia](https://www.dbpedia.org/resources/) and [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6256).
